#python script for retrieving log files, determining total number of requests, and getting requests in a 6 month time period
# By Lauren, Linda, Diego, and Harley

import requests

url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tcmg476/http_access_log"

r = requests.get(url, stream = True)

with open("python.txt","wb") as textfile:
    for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):

        if chunk:

            result={
            "total_requests":0,
}

file = open("python.txt")

total_requests = 0


for line in file: ## to go through each line and get total count
    word = "local"
    word1 = "remote"
    count = 0
    with open("python.txt", 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = line.split()
            for i in words:
                if (i == word):
                    count = count + 1
            words2 = line.split()
            for i in words:
                if (i == word1):
                    count = count + 1
        print(f'There are {count} number of requests')

###^^^there is definitely a more streamlined way to do this, but it should work
