#python script for retrieving log files, determining total number of requests, and getting requests in a 6 month time period
# By Lauren, Linda, Diego, and Harley

import requests

url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tcmg476/http_access_log"

r = requests.get(url, stream = True)

with open("python.txt","wb") as textfile:
    for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):

# writing to pdf file
        if chunk:
            textfile.write(chunk)
            result={
            "total_requests":0,
}

file = open("python.txt")

total_requests = 0


#Count the number of lines in python
with open('python.txt','r') as file:
   cnt = 0
   for line in file: 
      cnt += 1
print(f"The Total Number of Requests are: {cnt}")

###^^^this should count the number of lines instead of the occurrences of the starting works. Haven't tested it but might work better if someone can throw it into an interpreter
