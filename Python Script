#python script for retrieving log files, determining total number of requests, and getting requests in a 6 month time period
# By Lauren, Linda, Diego, and Harley

import requests

# finds date of last entry

# Question 2

    word = "local"
    word1 = "remote"
    count = 0

###^^^there is definitely a more streamlined way to do this, but it should work
